#### If I have cloned Qristal Core, how do I set the new GitHub repository as the `remote`?
```
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/qbrilliance/qristal-core.git
git fetch
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
```

#### If I have used Qristal Core as a git submodule of my project, how do I update this to use the new GitHub repository?
```
git rm your/project/path/to/Qristal-Core
git submodule add https://github.com/qbrilliance/qristal-core.git your/project/path/to/Qristal-Core
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### What will happen to my local repository if I donâ€™t take any action?

Your local repository will no longer be in sync with newer releases of Qristal.

#### Who can I contact if I have questions about the change to GitHub?

Please raise any questions with:

Qristal is the QB Software Development Kit for quantum computing.  This is its core module.

### Installation

**Prerequisites**

As of this release, only Linux (e.g., Ubuntu) is supported. One may also choose to use Ubuntu with WSL 2 ([Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)) installed, as the installation sequence is the same. The best performance is achieved with regular Linux, due to additional overhead coming from the Windows filesystem. Please ensure if using WSL that you turn on file system case sensitivity for the location where you intend to install Qristal.

At a minimum, the following packages are required:

- Python3.8+

- gcc, g++, and gfortran 11.4.0 or later.  Usage of clang 16.0.0 or later is supported, but gcc/g++ is still required for building exatn and tnqvm.

- cmake (version 3.20+)

- Boost 1.71+

- OpenBLAS

- OpenSSL

- Curl


For example, on the latest Debian-based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04 or above), we can use `apt` to install all above prerequisites.

```
sudo apt install build-essential cmake gfortran libboost-all-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libopenblas-dev libpython3-dev python3 python3-pip
```

Qristal will be built with support for CUDA Quantum if and only if cmake detects that your system has a compatible CUDA Quantum installation.

**Compilation**

<a name="compilation"></a>

After cloning the QB Qristal SDK repository, compile and install it with

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DINSTALL_MISSING=ON
make -j$(nproc) install
```

If you wish to only install missing C++ or Python dependencies, instead of passing `-DINSTALL_MISSING=ON` you can pass `-DINSTALL_MISSING=CXX` or `-DINSTALL_MISSING=PYTHON`.

If you also wish to build the C++ noise-aware circuit placement based on the [TKET](https://github.com/CQCL/tket) library, you can pass `-DWITH_TKET=ON` to `cmake`.

Along with the `-DINSTALL_MISSING=ON` option as shown above, `cmake` will automatically pull in and build TKET for you.
Alternatively, if you have an existing TKET installation, you can pass `-DWITH_TKET=ON -DTKET_DIR=<YOUR TKET INSTALLATION DIR>` to `cmake` to let it use your installation rather than building TKET from source.  

If you also wish to build the html documentation, you can pass `-DBUILD_DOCS=ON` to `cmake`.

## Documentation
You can find the docs for Qristal on the web at [qristal.readthedocs.io](https://qristal.readthedocs.io).  If you have built and installed the documentation (see [compilation](#compilation)), you can also find it at `<installation_directory>/docs/html/index.html`.
