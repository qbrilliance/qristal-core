# Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

The quantum Fourier transform is the quantum implementation of the discrete Fourier transform over the amplitudes of a wavefunction.

The discrete Fourier transform maps a vector $`(x_0, x_1, ..., x_{N-1})`$ to the vector $`(y_0, y_1, ..., y_{N-1})`$ given by the transformation

$``$
y_k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} x_j \omega_N^{jk}
$``$

where $`\omega_N^{jk} = e^{2 \pi i \frac{jk}{N}}`$.

In a similar fashion, QFT transforms a quantum state $`\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} x_i |i \rangle`$ to the quantum state $`\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} y_i |i \rangle`$ given by

$``$
|x \rangle \rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{y=0}^{N-1} \omega_N^{xy} |y \rangle
$``$

The corresponding unitary matrix is then given by

$``$
U_{QFT} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{x=0}^{N-1} \sum_{y=0}^{N-1} \omega_N^{xy} |y \rangle \langle x |
$``$

It is a good point to recall that QFT transforms between two bases, i.e. the computation (Z) basis and the Fourier basis. For example, a single-qubit QFT is the Hadamard gate operation, since it transforms between the *Z*-basis ($`|0 \rangle`$ and $`|1 \rangle`$) and the *X*-basis ($`|+ \rangle`$ and $`|- \rangle`$).
