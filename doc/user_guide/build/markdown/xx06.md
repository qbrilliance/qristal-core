# 5. Hardware Specifications and Limitations

## 5.1. Qubit Connectivity Diagram

In the context of quantum programming, we say that two qubits are connected if a CNOT operation can be directly applied to them. By this definition, all qubits on a QB diamond chip are effectively connected and this should be sufficient for most quantum programming applications.  

Direct physical connectivity is much more restricted. Qubits are physically arranged in fully connected clusters of three. The clusters are arranged in a two-dimensional grid with complete connectivity between the qubits of horizontal and vertical nearest neighbours. There are no diagonal physical connections. It follows that there can be no more than six qubits in a physically fully connected registry.

> **Figure 5.1:** Each cluster of three qubits lies inside a black circle, which represents a single NV centre. Intra-cluster connections are shown in red. Connections between clusters are in orange and split at each end to indicate that every qubit at one vertex is physically connected to every qubit at the nearest-neighbour vertex. There is no difference in the strength of intra- and inter- couplings â€” different colours are only used to facilitate presentation.

Physically distant qubits can still be connected in the quantum programming context described above, but in practice this may require the equivalent of a large number of swap operations, rendering such a connection less reliable.
