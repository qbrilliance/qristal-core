## 3.2. Importing from a circuit composition GUI and running in qbOS

For users who understand quantum circuits, see the following guides on exporting a circuit from third-party circuit composition GUIs and how to execute the circuit in qbOS:

## 3.3 qbOS circuit builder

### 3.3.1 Introduction

qbOS provides a `Circuit` class for users to construct quantum circuits from elementary gates, such as X, Y, Z, Hadamard, CNOT, etc. 

Users can use `Circuit`’s methods to compose the circuit as in the example below: 

- Construct the circuit:

Note: the list of supported gates is listed below.

```python
import qbos as qb
import re
tqb = qb.core()

nb_qubits = 12
circ = qb.Circuit()
circ.h(0)
# Entangle all qubits
for i in range(nb_qubits - 1):
    circ.cnot(i, i + 1)
circ.measure_all()
```

- Execute with qbOS:

We use the `ir_target` method of `tqb` to assign the circuit ready to run.

```python
tqb.qb12()
tqb.ir_target = circ
tqb.run()
```

- Inspect the shot outcomes:

```python
tqb.out_raw[0]
```

A sample result may look like the following, indicating entanglement as expected.

```
String[{
    "000000000000": 554,
    "111111111111": 470
}]
```
