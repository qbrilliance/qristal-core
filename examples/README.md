# Examples #

The `examples` folder contains a series of example C++ and Python main programs.

After installing the core (`make install` in the main project build folder of either the core or SDK), the Python programs can be run by simply invoking
```
python3 <name_of_example>.py
```

The C++ examples are installed as source files with working CMakeLists.txt build scripts, to demonstrate how to use the core library to build your own C++ main program. To build and run an example in the installation directory, do
```
cd <Qristal_installation_directory>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../examples/cpp/<name_of_example>
make
./<name_of_example>
```

The C++ example programs are _also_ built and properly linked automatically when running `make install` in the build folder of the core and SDK projects, but the resulting binaries are _not_ installed.  They simply appear in the main project build folder, and can be executed directly from there.

A description of the available gates and the syntax used to implement them in Python is given in the [Quantum Computing](https://qristal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst/quantum_computing.html) section.

Therefore the symbols in $S_{A}$ will be flagged in $F_{A/B}$ if and only if they are null or repeated or both.
